- Although the project will be designed with a modular approach with scope of future expansibility, it will be demonstrated on a much smaller scale, due to a lack of infrastructure and budget.
- Plug and Play modules with fine level of control will be developed only for Lights, Fans and Air Conditioners due to lack of budget and time. Rest of the devices will be controlled in only an On/Off state.
- Testing of the modules will be limited to the devices available in the institute.
- The performance of the sensor aggregator units will be limited to the quality and precision of the sensors used in it.
