A centralized device architecture will be used to design this Home Automation System (HAS), establishing a clear hierarchy between the devices and enabling simplified decision making. A higher level of device controllability provided by the plug and play modules will provide greater energy efficiency while maintaining user comfort. A Deep Reinforcement Learning model will allow the HAS to optimize its output over time, learning user behaviour and providing ever increasing efficiency to the system.
